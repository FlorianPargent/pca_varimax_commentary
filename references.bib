	abstract = {Recently, it has been proposed that a General Factor of Personality (GFP) occupies the top of the hierarchical personality structure. We present a meta-analysis (K = 212, total N = 144,117) on the intercorrelations among the Big Five personality factors (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) to test for the existence of a GFP. In addition, we report a multi-method validity study testing the relationship between the GFP and supervisor-rated job performance. The meta-analysis provided supporting evidence for the two meta-factors Stability and Plasticity (or a and b, respectively) and a GFP at the highest hierarchal level. The validity study indicated that the GFP has a substantive component as it is related to supervisor-rated job performance.},

	abstract = {This book presents a review of the work on multiple-factor analysis done in the past decade by Thurstone and his associates, and it presents in coherent fashion the mathematical development of multiple-factor analysis. The present book includes most of the material that was present in "The Vectors of Mind" (see 9: 5998). Much of the book is spent on methods of factorial analysis using examples which tend to point out clearly the problems involved. There is detailed discussion of various controversial areas.

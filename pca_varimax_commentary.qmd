New insights into PCA + Varimax for psychological researchers

@rohe2022vintage (R&Z) proof what many psychologists have suspected but is dismissed by the literature: Principal component analysis (PCA) in combination with Varimax rotation (VMR) *does* estimate factor scores in latent variable models. The factor indeterminacy problem which plagues VMR since its invention only applies for the special case of (multivariate) normally distributed factors. For any other distribution, perfect factor indeterminacy does not apply, although identifiability might be weak. However, distributions producing factors which are sparse or have a high kurtosis fulfill a *sufficient* leptokurtic condition, which enables PCA+VMR to estimate factors, and can be confirmed with simple diagnostic plots [@thurstone]. As psychologists, we appreciate new insights into "vintage" PCA+VMR, which is still the most common method for developing and evaluating psychological tests and questionnaires. From our experience, it is frustrating to teach factor analysis and rotational indeterminacy, followed by demonstrations of the effectiveness of PCA+VMR in analyzing the structure of psychological questionnaires. Despite practical success, the literature has fought against the use of PCA+VMR in favor of more complex exploratory factor analysis and oblique rotation methods. R&Z show that although EFA might be more efficient, simple PCA+VMR performs the same inference. However, their technical paper is difficult to read for psychological researchers, which is why we summarize the most important aspects in this commentary: In contrast to the examples in R&Z which only deal with sparse binary network data, psychological applications (traditionally) deal with i) questionnaire items or (increasingly) ii) digital data, e.g., mobile sensing. The $A$ matrix consists of i) integer valued responses on $d$ Likert-scale items or ii) continuous values on $d$ sensing variables by $n$ persons. In these contexts, degree normalization discussed by R&Q is not suitable and z-standardization is often required to detect meaningful factors in practice (see empirical example at LINK). We do not share R&Z's enthusiasm that *radial streaks* is also common in psychological applications. We used the `vsp` R-package to analyzed item responses by `r nrow(phonedata_items)` persons on `r ncol(phonedata_items)` personality items (n=`r nrow(phonedata_items)`,d=`r ncol(phonedata_items)`). Although PCA+VMR was quite effective to detect the theoretically implied Big Five factors, no *radial streaks* were detected (independently of the z-standardizationth). When analyzing `r ncol(phonedata_sensing)` mobile sensing variables in the same dataset (n=`r nrow(phonedata_sensing)`,d=`r ncol(phonedata_sensing)`), *radial streaks* were strong without z-standardization, but the factors are not interpretable. Interpretable factors are only detected with z-standardization, in which case *radial streaks* are much weaker. Another important theoretical and empirical aspect of psychological applications are correlated factors (e.g. the personality dimensions X and Y typically correlate as high as $r \approx ?$, and old theory implying that personality dimensions are independent are considered unreasonable in current personality theories), thus oblique rotations are often argued for. Interestingly, R&Z hint that in their semi-parametric factor model, their extension of PCA+VMR (which is an orthogonal rotation) might be used to also estimate correlated factors. Our online materials (LINK) demonstrate that $\hat{Z}\hat{B}$ correctly estimates correlated factors from a leptokurtic multivariate exponential distribution (both matrices are computed by the `vsp` package). While the R&Z's theoretical results could be highly relevant for widespread applications of PCA+VMR in psychology, details might differ. Psychology might profit from additional work on the role of the $B$ matrix, and how to estimate oblique factors and loadings in their semi-parametric factor model.

Rohe & Zeng (R&Z; @rohe2022vintage) proof what many psychologists have suspected but is dismissed by the literature: Principal component analysis in combination with Varimax rotation (PCA+VMR\; @kaiser1958varimax) *does* estimate factor scores in latent variable models. The factor indeterminacy problem which plagues VMR since its invention only applies for the special case of (multivariate) normally distributed factors. For any other distribution, perfect factor indeterminacy does not apply, although identifiability might be weak. However, distributions producing factors which are sparse or have a high kurtosis fulfill a *sufficient* leptokurtic condition, which enables PCA+VMR to estimate factors, and can be confirmed by simple diagnostics [@thurstone1947multiple].

As psychologists, we appreciate new insights into “vintage” PCA+VMR, which is still widely used for developing and evaluating psychological tests and questionnaires [@fokkema2017how]. From our experience, it is frustrating to teach factor analysis and rotational indeterminacy, followed by demonstrations of the effectiveness of PCA+VMR in analyzing the structure of psychological questionnaires. Despite practical success, the literature has fought against the use of PCA+VMR in favor of more complex exploratory factor analysis and oblique rotation methods. R&Z show that simple PCA+VMR performs the same inference. However, their technical paper is difficult to read for psychological researchers, which is why we summarize the most important aspects in this commentary:

In contrast to the examples in R&Z which only deal with sparse binary network data, psychological applications (traditionally) deal with i) questionnaire items or (increasingly) ii) digital data, e.g., mobile sensing. The $A$ matrix consists of i) integer-valued responses on $d$ Likert items or ii) continuous values on $d$ sensing variables, by $n$ persons. Degree normalization discussed by R&Q seems not suitable here and z-standardization is often required to detect meaningful factors in practice. We also do not share R&Z’s enthusiasm that "radial streaks" are common. In our online materials (<https://osf.io/5symf/>), we analyzed personality items ($n =`r nrow(phonedata_items)`$, $d =`r ncol(phonedata_items)`$; @stachl2020predicting). Although PCA+VMR was quite effective (with and without z-standardization) to detect the theoretically implied Big Five factors, no radial streaks were detected. When analyzing sensing variables in the same dataset ($n =`r nrow(phonedata_sensing)`$, $d =`r ncol(phonedata_sensing)`$), radial streaks were strong without z-standardization, but the factors were not interpretable. Interpretable factors were only detected with z-standardization, in which case radial streaks were much weaker.

Another important aspect of psychological applications are correlated factors (e.g. personality dimensions conscientiousness and neuroticism are thought to correlate around $-0.4$; @vanderlinden2010general), thus oblique rotations are often argued for. Interestingly, R&Z hint that in their semi-parametric factor model, their extension of PCA+VMR might be used to also estimate correlated factors. Our online materials demonstrate that $\hat{Z}\hat{B}$ correctly estimates correlated factors simulated from a leptokurtic distribution.

While R&Z’s results are highly relevant for widespread applications of PCA+VMR, details might differ in psychology which could profit from better understanding of the $B$ matrix, and how to estimate oblique factors and loadings.
